# Project-1-EasyA


The EasyA software package provides a local application that allows a user to analyze grade data through graphical comparisons. This is accomplished through launching an app that displays a user interface to interact with. Interactions include multiple drop-down menus to filter results such as “EasyA” or “JustPass” options, instructors versus regular faculty, and specific class departments. Software components include a front-end graphical user interface (GUI) running on the Python Tkinter library (Grade Comparison Interface), a set of processing module files that use Matplotlib to render graphs (Processing Modules), and a back-end SQLit3 database with a couple of Python scripts that load and update said database(Grade Records Modules). One of the scripts, when run by the system administrator, web-scrapes to collect new data for the database and stores the output into Faculty Department Information. Once the SQLit3 database is populated with data, the front-end Tkinter GUI can send filtered requests to the processing modules. The processing modules then coordinate with the record database using SQL queries which return filtered data. Once the data is returned to the processing modules,  it is collected, processed, and rendered into graphs using Matplotlib and Pandas. Finally, the processing module file returns the rendered graphs to be displayed on the Grade Comparison Interface GUI.
